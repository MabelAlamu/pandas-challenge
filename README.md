We will be analyzing the district-wide standardized test results of schools in PyCity. We have access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our responsibility is to aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance. The final report should include each of the following:


##District Summary; a table of the district's key metrics, including

Total Schools, Total Students,Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.), % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.), Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


##School Summary; a table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:

School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.), % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.), % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


##Top and Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing); a table that highlights the top and bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing, including:

School Name, School Type, Total Students, Total School Budget, Per Student Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.), % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.), % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)


##A table that lists the average Math and Reading Scores by Grade(9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


##Scores by School Spending (average spending ranges per student),School Size and School Type,including:

Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math (The percentage of students that passed math.), % Passing Reading (The percentage of students that passed reading.), % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
