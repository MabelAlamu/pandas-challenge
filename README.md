# Analysis of Standardized Test Scores 


This script analyzes the district-wide standardized test results of schools in PyCity. The [dataset](https://github.com/MabelAlamu/pandas-challenge/blob/main/PyCitySchools/students_complete.csv) contains every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. The PyCity performance report will aggregate the data and showcase obvious trends in school performance. The final report will include each of the following:


### District Summary

* A table with a high level snapshot of the district's key metrics, including:
  * Total Schools
  * Total Students
  * Total Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score 
  * The percentage of students that passed math
  * The percentage of students that passed reading
  * The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading


### School Summary- a table that summarizes key metrics about each school

* A table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * The percentage of students that passed math
  * The percentage of students that passed reading
  * The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading


### Top and Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)

* A table that highlights the top and bottom 5 performing schools based on the percentage of students that passed math and reading, including:
  * School Name
  * School Type
  * Total Students
  * Total School Budget
  * Per Student Budget
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * The percentage of students that passed math
  * The percentage of students that passed reading
  * The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading


### Math and Reading Scores by Grade

* A table that lists the average Reading Score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.


### Scores by School Spending (average spending ranges per student),School Size and School Type

* A table that breaks down school performances based on average Spending Ranges (Per Student), another table that group schools based on a reasonable approximation of school size (Small, Medium, Large), and a table that groups the schools based on school type (Charter vs. District). Each table should include the following:
  * Average Math Score
  * Average Reading Score
  * The percentage of students that passed math
  * The percentage of students that passed reading
  * The percentage of students that passed math **and** reading
